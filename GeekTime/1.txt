Serial elastic actuators (SEAs) are a kind of driving devices that adds elastic elements between the actuator and its load[1]. The introduction of the elastic element brings  passive flexible to the robot which could buffer the external forces and ensure the security of robots when contact with the environment and human. At the same time the output force of SEAs can be achieved more accurately by measuring the defection of elastic element, thus improve the force control precision of SEAs for interaction environment which is considered as a delicate task in robotics since the very beginning of the experiment in 1950s[2]. Therefore, a large number of scholars have made a lot of research works on the force/torque control of SEAs
