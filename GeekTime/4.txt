A main problem in force control is that performance does not only depends on robot’s but also on environment’s dynamics, which is usually uncertain and time variant. This problem is more pronounced in force control of SEAs because the dynamic model of SEA is decoupled by elastic element that freedom of the system is increased. Within the SEA literature of the last decade, control tuning is usually based on a predetermined nominal environment (usually stiff), which may significantly differ from real-world scenarios[15,16]. In addition to cascade PID control, the above methods all consider that the position and speed signals can be directly measured. However, due to constraints of weight and cost in practical applications, speed sensors are often not installed, so the speed signals are obtained by numerical differential calculation, which often brings a lot of measurement noise and is easy to cause system vibration.
