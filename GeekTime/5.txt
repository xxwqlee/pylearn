Considering the above problems, this paper in view of the force control of SEAs for the human-robot interaction with unknown payload, set up a model of SEAs force source in the vertical plane. Then the dynamic model was simplified and an active disturbance rejection control(ADRC) was designed. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out using MATLAB/ADAMS co-simulation and the effectiveness of control measures are compared with cascade PID control method .
