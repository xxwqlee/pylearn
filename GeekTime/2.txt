Serial elastic actuator was originally proposed by Pratt[3] in 1995 and a kind of PID with feedforward method was designed. Cascade PID control method, with inner loop of position control and outer loop of force control, was introduced by Pratt[4] a few years later. After that Wyeth[5] replace the inner loop of cascade PID by motor velocity control, Tagliamonte[6] combined cascade PID method with impedance control theory. Cascade PID strategy is widely used in force control of SEAs nowadays[7,8,9,10], this kind of method consider the motor or hydraulic cylinder as an ideal location or speed output source, the position or speed of the motor or hydraulic cylinder is realized by its internal feedback control loop. Although the control of this dynamic model is easy to realize, there is still a large steady-state error in the final control effect due to the modeling error and the limitation of the actual system internal position loop or speed loop bandwidth
