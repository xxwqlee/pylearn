 For serial elastic actuator systems,most existing methods based on a predetermined 
 nominal environment (usually stiff). However, in practical applications the dynamics 
 of environment are mostly unknown and time-varying, which makes the control problem 
 more challenging. Additionally, Many works fail to take SEA as a actuator into 
 consideration in practical applications while time-varying ground torque signals need
  to be output. To deal with these problems, an active disturbance rejection control 
  method is proposed for SEA force control in an interactive environment. Specifically,
   by considering the periodically changed dynamics of load as the disturbance of SEA 
   interacting with environment, the dynamics of SEA was derived and simplified, then 
   a ADRC based force control framework were built within a nonlinear extended state 
   observer, a sliding mode differentiator and a nonlinear feedback controller. 
   Finally, the effectiveness of ADRC based force controller were proofed and compared
   with traditional cascade PID controller by using MATLAB/ADAMS Co-simulation.
